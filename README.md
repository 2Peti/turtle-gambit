# GAMBIT MAIN PLAN

1. Get ludwig to set up a single turtle. Ideally in town or a central area.
2. Preparation. Mine for coal and resources to self-replicate.
3. Advertisement. Start placing "Turtles are People" signs on the server.
4. Contact Michael. Approach with turtle and:
	- ask to talk on discord / twitter?
	- link him to a screenshot of the UI
	- roleplay as the turtle: ask for fuel or something
	- obfuscate code and add twitter / discord as comment
5. Michael gets Abe to whitelist me
